Building instruction

If trying to build fails because opencl.h files couldn't be located, change the line
include_directories(/usr/local/cuda-7.5/targets/x86_64-linux/include)

in analyze.cl for the directory for CL/cl.h, on linux you can easily find it with locate
locate CL/cl.h

Run instruction

open_cl_histogram {input_bmp_file} {histogram_result}

If you run it on a Optimus device, and have Bumblebee installed, you should
run it with optirun(if you don't know what those are, don't worry about it)

optirun ./open_cl_histogram {input_bmp_file} {histogram_result}
